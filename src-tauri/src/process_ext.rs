//! Cross-platform helpers for spawning child processes that are tied to the
//! lifetime of the parent app process and (on Windows) don't pop up a
//! console window.
//!
//! Originally lifted from Flowsta Vault (see flowsta-vault/src-tauri/src/process_ext.rs).
//! Comments mention "v0.5.0/0.5.1/0.5.2" — those are Vault version
//! references describing how this approach was arrived at and what
//! pitfalls were ruled out along the way; kept verbatim for context.
//!
//! Without `tie_to_parent`, lair-keystore and the holochain conductor outlive
//! the parent app when it's killed (SIGKILL, OOM, dev-mode reload, dpkg
//! upgrade, …) and hold the conductor admin-WS port, blocking the next
//! launch.
//!
//! Without `spawn_hidden`, on Windows every app launch flashes two terminal
//! windows (lair-keystore.exe + holochain.exe) — visually unprofessional and
//! confusing for end users.
//!
//! Linux: `prctl(PR_SET_PDEATHSIG, SIGTERM)`.
//! Windows: post-spawn `EnumWindows` + `ShowWindow(SW_HIDE)` for the new
//! process's top-level console windows.
//! macOS: no-op for now. Clean exits work via `RunEvent::Exit`; abnormal
//! terminations on macOS / Windows can still leak children. Job Objects
//! (Windows) and kqueue (macOS) remain TODO.
//!
//! ## Why post-spawn hide instead of `CREATE_NO_WINDOW`
//!
//! v0.5.0 set `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` (0x08000000) on Windows to suppress the
//! console windows. That flag does more than hide the window — it prevents
//! Windows from allocating a console handle at all. `holochain.exe` then
//! crashed with `0xc0000005` access violation in `MSVCP140.dll` during
//! signing-DNA WASM compilation, because LLVM/cranelift's stdio path
//! dereferences the (null) console handle. v0.5.1 reverted to default flags
//! to restore reliable installs but at the cost of visible terminals.
//!
//! v0.5.2's approach: spawn normally so the console is allocated and
//! handles work, then enumerate the new process's top-level windows and
//! `ShowWindow(SW_HIDE)` each one. There's a brief flash (~50ms) while we
//! find and hide the window, but no crashes. The polled hide thread retries
//! for up to 2 seconds, so even if the window appears late we still catch
//! it. To eliminate the flash entirely, a future change could spawn with
//! `CREATE_SUSPENDED` via raw `CreateProcessW`, hide the window, then
//! `ResumeThread` — much more invasive and not necessary for the MVP.

    //! suppress the console windows that pop up when we spawn console-mode
    //! sidecars on Windows.
    //!
    //! ## Why always-hide on every poll
    //!
    //! The previous implementation exited early when it found a matching
    //! window that wasn't currently visible (`IsWindowVisible == 0`),
    //! reasoning the child was using a hidden IPC window we shouldn't
    //! flap. That was wrong — Windows console hosts (conhost) create
    //! their window with WS_VISIBLE off and toggle it on later, often
    //! after our few-poll budget had already elapsed. Result: terminal
    //! windows reliably appeared after we'd "given up".
    //!
    //! Now we poll for a 12 s budget and call `ShowWindow(SW_HIDE)` on every
    //! match every iteration regardless of current visibility. `SW_HIDE` is
    //! idempotent on already-hidden windows, so the worst case is a brief
    //! visibility flicker between the OS toggling `WS_VISIBLE` on and our next
    //! poll catching it.
    //!
    //! The 12 s (not 3 s) budget exists because the lair-keystore children
    //! pop their console window within ~150 ms, but the **holochain conductor**
    //! compiles WASM on startup and only shows its console window several
    //! seconds in — after a 3 s budget had already given up, so the conductor
    //! window leaked and stayed visible. We poll fast (50 ms) for the first
    //! 2 s to catch lair with minimal flicker, then back off to 200 ms for the
    //! long tail so watching for the conductor's late window stays cheap.
    //!
    //! We also log the window class on the first match per pid so we can
    //! verify we're finding the actual `ConsoleWindowClass` window vs.
    //! some unrelated internal window.
